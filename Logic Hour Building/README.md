# Logic Building Hour

## Day 1

Objective of Day 1 and Day 2 : Learn the basics of the programming language

During the first two days of PBL, the students should have learnt the fundamentals of programming language and should be comfortable with the basic programming constructs.

- conditional statements

- looping constructs

- data types

## Day 2

By the end of Day 2 : Students should be able to demonstrate their understanding of ‘conditions’ and ‘loops’ by being able to write the below programs


### Programs to demonstrate learner’s understanding of “Conditional statements”.

- Write a program to accept a number N and print whether it is positive, negative or zero

- Write a program to accept two numbers and print the greater value of the two

- Write a program to accept a number N and print whether the number is EVEN or ODD

- Write a program to accept two numbers and print whether their sum is EVEN or ODD

 

### Programs to demonstrate learner’s understanding of “Looping constructs”

- Write a program to print all numbers from 1 to 100 i.e. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 . . . 98 99 100

- Write a program to print alternate numbers starting from 1 to 99 i.e. 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 . . . 95 97 99

- Write a program to print alternate numbers starting from 0 to 100 i.e. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 . . . 96 98 100

- Write a program to print all numbers backwards from 100 to 0 i.e. 100 99 98 97 96 . . . 4 3 2 1 0

- Write a program to print numbers backwards from 100 to 1 by skipping 2 numbers i.e. 100 97 94 91 88 85 82 79. . . 22 19 16 13 10 7 4 1

## Day 3

Students who have NOT been able to complete the above mentioned programs on day-2, MUST complete them on day-3.

Objective of Day3 : Learn the use of division / and mod % operations to solve problems

Solve the below questions using the respective IDE (Eclipse for Java,  Visual studio for C#,  vi for C/C++)

#### 1. Is Even?

- Write a function to find whether the given input number is Even.
- If the given number is even, the function should return 2 else it should return 1.
- Note: The number passed to the function can be negative, positive or zero. Zero should be treated as Even.

#### 2. Is Odd?

- Write a function to find whether the given input number is Odd.
- If the given number is odd, the function should return 2 else it should return 1.
- Note: The number passed to the function can be negative, positive or zero. Zero should NOT be treated as odd.

#### 3. Return last digit of the given number

- Write a function that returns the last digit of the given number.
- Last digit is being referred to the least significant digit i.e. the digit in the ones (units) place in the given number.
- The last digit should be returned as a positive number.

**for example,**
```
if the given number is 197, the last digit is 7

if the given number is -197, the last digit is 7
```

#### 4. Return second last digit of the given number

- Write a function that returns the second last digit of the given number.
- Second last digit is being referred to the digit in the tens place in the given number.

**for example,**

```
if the given number is 197, the second last digit is 9
```
 
**Note 1** - The second last digit should be returned as a positive number.

i.e. if the given number is -197, the second last digit is 9

**Note 2** - If the given number is a single digit number, then the second last digit does not exist. In such cases, the function should return -1.

i.e. if the given number is 5, the second last digit should be returned as -1

#### 5. Sum of last digits of two given numbers

Rohit wants to add the last digits of two given numbers.

**For example,**

If the given numbers are 267 and 154, the output should be 11.

Below is the explanation -

Last digit of the 267 is 7

Last digit of the 154 is 4

Sum of 7 and 4 = 11
 
Write a program to help Rohit achieve this for any given two numbers.

 The prototype of the method should be -

int addLastDigits(int input1, int input2);

where input1 and input2 denote the two numbers whose last digits are to be added.

**Note:** The sign of the input numbers should be ignored.

i.e.

if the input numbers are 267 and 154, the sum of last two digits should be 11

if the input numbers are 267 and -154, the sum of last two digits should be 11

if the input numbers are -267 and 154, the sum of last two digits should be 11

if the input numbers are -267 and -154, the sum of last two digits should be 11

# Day 4
Objective of Day 4 : Learn the usage of the mettl tool.
